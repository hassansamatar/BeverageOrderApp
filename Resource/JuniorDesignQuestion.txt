As a caring manager, I like to make sure my team is kept refreshed by making the mid-morning beverages. However, as the team gets bigger I find it difficult to remember who has what. So, what I'd like is a simple application that will:-
1. Enable each team member to add their preferences.
2. Enable me to see a list of team members and their beverages of choice.

In order to prevent people being silly and, for example, specifying "Gin and Tonic" as their beverage, I need the selection to be made from a specified list.  It should be possible for me to edit this list to add additional choices (if, for example, someone develops a liking for Lapsang Souchong).
When specifying their beverage, team members must also be able to specify the following additions:-
	Milk
	Non-dairy milk substitute
	Sugar
	Sweetener
	Strength (one of Weak/Normal/Strong)
Not all of these will likely be applicable to all beverages (for example, I don't think anyone should be allowed to drink Earl Grey with milk ;)  ), but for simplicity all of the additions should be shown regardless of the beverage selected.

Please produce :-
1. A suitable data-base schema for the above.
2. A design for key parts of the application.  This could include wire-frames, class structures, etc.

It is absolutely not necessary to provide a working implementation for this (it is not a test of coding skills).  You may, however prefer to show snippets of code to illustrate some aspects of your design, which is fine.  
Should any part of the requirement be unclear, please make a reasonable assumption, but also note any questions you'd ask to seek clarification.  Also, please feel free to make suggestions for any potential improvements you think might be worth considering.
